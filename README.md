# Hepatitis-Mortality-Prediction
A Machine Learning Web App which uses UCI Hepatits dataset to predict Hepatitis Mortality Rate.
This App has been deployed to Heroku. You can [Click Here](https://hepatitis-mortality-pred.herokuapp.com/) to check it out.

The frontend has been made using Streamlit.
I've used all the popular Machine Learning Algorithms like RandomForest Classifier, KNN Classifier etc, and have used Scikit-Learn
to implement the said algorithms.
